# Setup Guide

This quick start guide assumes that you are already reasonably familiar with weeWX and that it is already installed on your computer along with a webserver, php and curl. For a light-touch webserver, Lighttpd is a good choice. A good guide for installing PHP 7.0 and Lighttpd on a RaspberryPi can be found at https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-lighttpd/

IMPORTANT. After installing PHP please make sure you install all the PHP modules appropriate for your version of PHP. Failure to due so may mean that forecasts and current conditions fail to update. This is an example for PHP7.3 modules on a Debian based distribution: -

	apt-get install php7.3-pear php7.3-curl php7.3-dev php7.3-gd php7.3-mbstring php7.3-zip php7.3-mysql php7.3-xml

The weewx folder must reside in the root directory of your web server. This is the default location if you followed the weeWX install process (http://www.weewx.com/docs/debian.htm) on a Debian based operating system (Debian, Ubuntu, Raspbian etc). 

To enable weeWX to communicate with the weather34 dashboard template, you must install the CRT plugin, (stands for Cumulus Real Time). Please follow the detailed instructions at https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki/crt. After installation edit the weewx-conf file. Go to the  [CumulusRealTime] which will likely be near the end of the script. Change this section to reflect the following: -

		[CumulusRealTime]
    			filename = /var/www/html/weewx/realtime.txt
    			unit_system = METRIC

If your path to your web root is different, please amend the path in front of '/weewx/realtime.txt' accordingly

Download the current version of WX-HWS-master zip file at https://github.com/steepleian/weather34-Home-Weatherstation-Template-weeWX-adapted

This new version will require a clean install to function correctly but please make sure that you retain the following folders: - weewx, skins (if you have moved it to your web root), chartswu, chartswudata and chartsweewx, also any other files and folders that you require for other applications. 

Extract all the files and folders and then upload them to the root directory of your web server, to sit alongside the weewx folder and the other folders you retained. Alternatively you may upload the zip file and then extract in-situ. (Please note that placing all the template files and folders in the root is a deviation from the recommendation for the Cumulus version of the template, which is to create a separate folder eg ‘pws’).

Important. Depending on the configuration of your server, you may have to change your file permissions. Change all files and folders recursively in the root of your server to 0775 using CHMOD and user to your Linux login name and groups to www-data using CHOWN, either via the CLI or your server Control Panel (if you employ one). I use Webmin http://www.webmin.com/deb.html, an open source control panel which will make your tasks much easier.

You can now test that the template is working by opening it up in your browser. Initially you will see random demo data. Click on the menu button at the top-left corner and select settings. This will open up a web form in which you apply your own settings. Pay particular attention to the location of the realtime.txt file being generated on a loop cycle by weeWX. The default location is “/var/tmp/weewx/realtime.txt”

If you intend to use your own weeWX data archive to generate the pop-up charts (wxcharts setting), please refer to the 'ARCHIVE-CHARTS-SETUP-GUIDE.md' document for further setup instructions.

For an in depth guide on configuring a remote server please refer to 'taylormia_remote_server_setup.pdf'

Finally re-start weewx and refresh your browser and you should see your own live weather station data. If things go wrong, check your settings carefully ensuring that the realtime.txt file and API keys and tokens have been correctly entered.
